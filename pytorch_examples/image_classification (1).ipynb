The idea is to add a randomly initialized classification head on top of a pre-trained encoder, and fine-tune the model altogether on a labeled dataset.\n\n## ImageFolder\n\nThis notebook leverages the [ImageFolder](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.0.0/en/image_process#imagefolder) feature to easily run the notebook on a custom dataset (namely, [EuroSAT](https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT) in this tutorial). You can either load a `Dataset` from local folders or from local/remote files, like zip or tar.\n\n## Any model\n\nThis notebook is built to run on any image classification dataset with any vision model checkpoint from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/) as long as that model has a TensorFlow version with a Image Classification head, such as:\n* [ViT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vit#transformers.TFViTForImageClassification)\n* [Swin Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/swin#transformers.TFSwinForImageClassification)\n* [ConvNeXT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/convnext#transformers.TFConvNextForImageClassification)\n* [RegNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/regnet#transformers.TFRegNetForImageClassification)\n* [ResNet](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/resnet#transformers.TFResNetForImageClassification)\n\n- in short, any model supported by [TFAutoModelForImageClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.TFAutoModelForImageClassification).\n\n## Data augmentation\n\nThis notebook leverages TensorFlow's [image](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/image) module for applying data augmentation. Alternative notebooks which leverage other libraries such as [Albumentations](https://albumentations.ai/) to come!\n\n---\n\nDepending on the model and the GPU you are using, you might need to adjust the batch size to avoid out-of-memory errors.

Leaving the loss field blank will cause the model to read the loss head as its loss value.\n\nThis is an unusual quirk of TensorFlow models in \ud83e\udd17 Transformers, so it's worth elaborating on in a little more detail. All \ud83e\udd17 Transformers models are capable of computing an appropriate loss for their task internally (for example, a CausalLM model will use a cross-entropy loss). To do this, the labels must be provided in the input dict (or equivalently, in the `columns` argument to `to_tf_dataset()`), so that they are visible to the model during the forward pass.\n\nThis is quite different from the standard Keras way of handling losses, where labels are passed separately and not visible to the main body of the model, and loss is handled by a function that the user passes to `compile()`, which uses the model outputs and the label to compute a loss value.\n\nThe approach we take is that if the user does not pass a loss to `compile()`, the model will assume you want the **internal** loss. If you are doing this, you should make sure that the labels column(s) are included in the **input dict** or in the `columns` argument to `to_tf_dataset`.\n\nIf you want to use your own loss, that is of course possible too!
