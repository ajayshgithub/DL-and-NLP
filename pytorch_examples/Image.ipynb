The idea is to add a randomly initialized classification head on top of a pre-trained encoder, and fine-tune the model altogether on a labeled dataset.\n\n## ImageFolder\n\nThis notebook leverages the [ImageFolder](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/v2.0.0/en/image_process#imagefolder) feature to easily run the notebook on a custom dataset (namely, [EuroSAT](https://github.com/phelber/EuroSAT) in this tutorial). You can either load a `Dataset` from local folders or from local/remote files, like zip or tar.\n\n## Any model\n\nThis notebook is built to run on any image classification dataset with any vision model checkpoint from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/) as long as that model has a version with a Image Classification head, such as:\n* [ViT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vit#transformers.ViTForImageClassification)\n* [Swin Transformer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/swin#transformers.SwinForImageClassification)\n* [ConvNeXT](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/master/en/model_doc/convnext#transformers.ConvNextForImageClassification)\n\n- in short, any model supported by [AutoModelForImageClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForImageClassification).\n\n## Data augmentation\n\nThis notebook leverages Torchvision's [transforms](https://pytorch.org/vision/stable/transforms.html) for applying data augmentation - note that we do provide alternative notebooks which leverage other libraries, including:\n\n* [Albumentations](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/image_classification_albumentations.ipynb)\n* [Kornia](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/image_classification_kornia.ipynb)\n* [imgaug](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/image_classification_imgaug.ipynb). \n\n---\n\nDepending on the model and the GPU you are using, you might need to adjust the batch size to avoid out-of-memory errors. Set those two parameters, then the rest of the notebook should run smoothly.\n\nIn this notebook, we'll fine-tune from the https://huggingface.co/microsoft/swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224 checkpoint, but note that there are many, many more available on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models?other=vision)."], "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"id": "0_0.1663892064429342"}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["model_checkpoint = \"microsoft/swin-tiny-patch4-window7-224\" # pre-trained model from which to fine-tune\nbatch_size = 32 # batch size for training and evaluation"], "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"id": "0_0.7692091270970736"}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["Before we start, let's install the `datasets` and `transformers` libraries."], "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"id": "0_0.647687112789282"}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["!!pip install -q datasets transformers"], "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"id": "0_0.39299118786416565"}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["If you're opening this notebook locally, make sure your environment has an install from the last version of those libraries.\n\nTo be able to share your model with the community and generate results like the one shown in the picture below via the inference API, there are a few more steps to follow.\n\nFirst you have to store your authentication token from the Hugging Face website (sign up [here](https://huggingface.co/join) if you haven't already!) then execute the following cell and input your token:"], "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"id": "0_0.0005173391915012093"}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["from huggingface_hub import notebook_login\n\nnotebook_login()"], "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"id": "0_0.4772697829550758"}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["\nThen you need to install Git-LFS to upload your model checkpoints:"], "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"id": "0_0.4753451364808301"}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["%%capture\n!!sudo apt -qq install git-lfs\n!!git config --global credential.helper store"], "outputs": []}, {"cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {"id": "0_0.6993863212784996"}, "execution_count": null, "source": ["We also quickly upload some telemetry - this tells us which examples and software versions are getting used so we know where to prioritize our maintenance efforts.
